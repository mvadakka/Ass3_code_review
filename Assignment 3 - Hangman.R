#Hangman

#PLAN
#1. Prepare a dictionary of words to choose from and save it in a txt file (one column) 
#and save it in the project directory
#2. Read the word list from your program
#3. Choose a random element from the list
#Create a nice opening prompt to the game 
#4. Inform the user on the length of the secret word 
#5. Inform the user about the number of wrong guesses/tries allowed
#Decide on the rule here and implement it

#While loop (condition - when wrong guesses < max wrong guess then continue with loop) 
#Break: end it when guess word = secret word (or in our case it would be when the _ _ _ is all filled)
#Notify users they won! 

#Text to display current state of the game for users

#6. Ask for user input
#7a. Check System for one character (IF)
  #Check if the character is a letter
  #Make sure that both lower and upper case letters are acceptable and treated as equivalent
#8a. Check to see if the user input is in the secret word (correct)
  #If yes, notify user and ask for next letter or guess the whole word
  #If not, notify user
      #If user has not exhausted the available tries repeat
      #OR 
      #If tries are exhausted, notify user that theyâ€™ve lost. Reveal secret and exit 
      #(This will bring it back to the while loop but the condition of 
      #wrong_guesses < max_wrong_guesses is not satisfied)

#7b. Check system if user input > 2 characters, doesn't have punctuation, spaces, etc. (ELSEIF)
  #This means the user tried guessing the full word and got it wrong
  #They need to try again
  #If they enter the wrong full word, they will not get any hints from entering that word
  #if they guessed the full word and got it right, congratulate them, break the loop and exit

#7c. ELSE - invalid input try again

#####' 1. MV: Love your detailed plan in the beginning, helps user know what to expect from the code.
#####' 2. MV: When multiple letters are inputted, attempt is reduced and it doesn't let the user know "invalid input" as it
#####' does for a number - this can be easily fixed by including nchar(secret_word) != 1 within the if else statements where
#####' numbers are considered invalid.
#####' 3. MV: Another tip is to include all the code from line 64 - 185 in a function called hangman() <- function [line 64-185], 
#####' and then after line 185 state hangman(). By doing this, as soon as the user calls hangman() all the code from lines 64-185
#####' will automatically run and user won't have to run each section of code every time. I did this so you can see how it works
#####' 4. MV: It might be helpful to include number of guesses at least as many times as letters in the secret word (i.e. 8 letter word, 8 guesses)
#####' otherwise it's hard to guess (might be skill issue lol)
#####' 5. MV: Your code from line 181-183 doesn't seem to work, as when I run out of attempts I do not receive the "Unfortunately.."
#####' prompt and the secret word is not revealed. I think this is happening because you use an if statement rather than else, 
#####' it might be better if you use elseif for all the statements right after the initial if else statement, and make the last
#####' statement "else". This might help ensure the last piece of code runs.
#####' 6. MV: Also, it might help you break up your if else statments so they only have a few conditions (2-4) and else statments, 
#####' otherwise it can be a bit hard to keep track of whats happening where and hard to fix issues like the one just mentioned 
#####' since the statements are so intertwined 
#####' 7. MV: Otherwise great job :) everything is working as it should!!
